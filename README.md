# Data Analyst Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects showcasing my skills as a data analyst. The projects cover a range of topics and demonstrate my proficiency in SQL, Python, and data visualization techniques using Tableau. The following is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

## Projects

## 1. Nashville Housing Data Analysis
In this project, I cleaned and analyzed Nashville housing data using SQL. The dataset was provided in an XLSX file format, and I utilized SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. The analysis involved exploring various aspects of the housing market, such as prices, locations, and trends. The results were then visualized using Tableau, allowing for easy interpretation and presentation of the findings.

## 2. COVID-19 Cases Analysis
For this project, I worked with COVID-19 cases data, also in an XLSX file format. Using SQL, I formulated queries to extract relevant information and uncover patterns in the data. The queries provided valuable insights into the global impact of the pandemic, including infection rates, mortality rates, and regional trends. I transformed these query results into an interactive dashboard using Tableau, enabling a comprehensive visualization of the data.

## 3. Movie Success Analysis
In this project, I focused on analyzing a dataset of over 7,600 movies using Python. By cleaning and processing the dataset, I explored the relationship between various factors, such as budget, revenue, genre, and rating, and their influence on a movie's success. The analysis revealed interesting insights, such as the correlation between higher budgets and higher revenues, as well as genre preferences among audiences. The findings were effectively communicated through engaging visualizations, providing valuable insights into the movie industry.

Each project within this repository demonstrates my ability to leverage data analysis tools and techniques to extract insights and communicate findings effectively. The accompanying code and documentation provide detailed information on the methodologies employed and can serve as evidence of my skills and experience as a data analyst.

### Nashville Housing Data Analysis

In this project, I cleaned and analyzed Nashville Housing Data. The dataset was provided in an Excel file format (`nashville_housing_data.xlsx`). The SQL queries used for data cleaning and analysis are available in the `nashville_housing_queries.sql` file.

#### Project Structure
```bash
├── nashville_housing_data.xlsx
└── nashville_housing_queries.sql
```
#### Requirements

To replicate the analysis, you will need:

- SQL database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL)

#### Usage

To reproduce the data analysis, follow these steps:

1. Import the provided Excel dataset (`nashville_housing_data.xlsx`) into your SQL database.
2. Execute the SQL queries in the `nashville_housing_queries.sql` file.

### COVID-19 Cases Analysis

For this project, I worked with COVID-19 cases data. The dataset was provided in an Excel file format (`CovidVaccinations.xlsx`) and (`CovidDeaths.xlsx`). I performed SQL queries on this data to extract meaningful insights and trends. The SQL queries used can be found in the `covid19_cases_queries.sql` file.

#### Visualization

To better understand and communicate the findings from the COVID-19 cases analysis, I utilized Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides visual representations of the queried data and helps to identify patterns and trends in global COVID-19 cases. You can access the dashboard in the `covid19_cases_dashboard.twbx` file.

#### Project Structure
```
├── CovidVaccinations.xlsx
├── CovidDeaths.xlsx
├── covid19_cases_queries.sql
└── covid19_cases_dashboard.twbx
```

#### Requirements

To replicate the analysis and visualize the data, you will need the following:

- SQL database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public

#### Usage

To reproduce the data analysis or visualize the data, follow these steps:

1. Import the provided Excel datasets (`CovidVaccinations.xlsx`) and (`CovidDeaths.xlsx`) into your SQL database.
2. Execute the SQL queries in the `covid19_cases_queries.sql` file.
3. Import the queried data into Tableau.
4. Open the Tableau workbook (`covid19_cases_dashboard.twb`) to explore the interactive dashboard.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code and data to suit your needs.
