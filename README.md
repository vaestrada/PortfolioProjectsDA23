# Data Analyst Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a collection of my data analysis projects as a Data Analyst. The projects included here demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, querying, and visualization using SQL and Tableau.

## Projects

### Nashville Housing Data Analysis

In this project, I cleaned and analyzed Nashville Housing Data. The dataset was provided in an Excel file format (`nashville_housing_data.xlsx`). The SQL queries used for data cleaning and analysis are available in the `nashville_housing_queries.sql` file.

#### Project Structure
```bash
├── nashville_housing_data.xlsx
└── nashville_housing_queries.sql
```
#### Requirements

To replicate the analysis, you will need:

- SQL database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL)

#### Usage

To reproduce the data analysis, follow these steps:

1. Import the provided Excel dataset (`nashville_housing_data.xlsx`) into your SQL database.
2. Execute the SQL queries in the `nashville_housing_queries.sql` file.

### COVID-19 Cases Analysis

For this project, I worked with COVID-19 cases data. The dataset was provided in an Excel file format (`CovidVaccinations.xlsx`) and (`CovidDeaths.xlsx`). I performed SQL queries on this data to extract meaningful insights and trends. The SQL queries used can be found in the `covid19_cases_queries.sql` file.

#### Visualization

To better understand and communicate the findings from the COVID-19 cases analysis, I utilized Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard provides visual representations of the queried data and helps to identify patterns and trends in global COVID-19 cases. You can access the dashboard in the `covid19_cases_dashboard.twbx` file.

#### Project Structure
```
├── CovidVaccinations.xlsx
├── CovidDeaths.xlsx
├── covid19_cases_queries.sql
└── covid19_cases_dashboard.twbx
```

#### Requirements

To replicate the analysis and visualize the data, you will need the following:

- SQL database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public

#### Usage

To reproduce the data analysis or visualize the data, follow these steps:

1. Import the provided Excel datasets (`CovidVaccinations.xlsx`) and (`CovidDeaths.xlsx`) into your SQL database.
2. Execute the SQL queries in the `covid19_cases_queries.sql` file.
3. Import the queried data into Tableau.
4. Open the Tableau workbook (`covid19_cases_dashboard.twb`) to explore the interactive dashboard.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code and data to suit your needs.
